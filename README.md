# PACTF-problemset

Problem writers: make a new folder containing the grader script etc (along with any makefiles, source, binaries, etc). The two things we definitely need are the grader script and a json file containing the relevant mongo data (format of said json object can be found in the picoctf-framework repos)

# Storybook?

I have no ideas on how to make the contest super legit on a meta level, but I want to draw inspiration from pythonchallenge and make a set of sequential problems that build off each other. Specifically, you'll want to keep track of stuff from problems 1-5 to tackle problem 6 (etc). I'm thinking to put these under a separate category and make a warning "YOU WILL NEED TO HANG ON TO EVERYTHING YOU GET HERE", and unlock them as the previous is completed. IDK, is this just a shitty idea?
