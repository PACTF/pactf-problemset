## Storybook?

I have no ideas on how to make the contest super legit on a meta level, but I want to draw inspiration from pythonchallenge and make a set of sequential problems that build off each other. Specifically, you'll want to keep track of stuff from problems 1-5 to tackle problem 6 (etc). I'm thinking to put these under a separate category and make a warning "YOU WILL NEED TO HANG ON TO EVERYTHING YOU GET HERE", and unlock them as the previous is completed. IDK, is this just a shitty idea? â€” Cam
