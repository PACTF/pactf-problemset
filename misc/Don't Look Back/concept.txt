Yatharth brought up catastrophic backtracking as a problem idea way back
forever ago; I think a cool problem would be to give a list of random
characters (or random "words"!) and then a list of like, 1000 regexes,
some of which explode and some of which don't. The flag, then, would be
the word in the big text file that matches all 1000 regexes.
