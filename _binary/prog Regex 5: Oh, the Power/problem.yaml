description: >
    By now, you are acquainted with the powers of regex, but can you make a regex to match only a power of 5 numbers of ‘x’s?
hint: >
    Take away 4/5ths of a power of 5, and you still have a power of 5.

    >! Consume some ‘x’s, the same number anorher 3 times, where 5 times was the entire string, and repeat.
