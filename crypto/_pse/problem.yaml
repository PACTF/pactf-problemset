  We found a bunch of [weird numbers]({% ctfstatic points.txt %}) that we're
  pretty sure is an encrypted message. There was also
  [this script]({% ctfstatic encrypt.py %}) lying around near it, but we don't
  know how it works. Can you help us?

hint: |
  Don't search for point-slope encryption; we made it up. I wonder what exactly
  this function does? If you plotted this stuff on a graph, what would you
  get? More importantly, I wonder where I've seen that s() function before...
