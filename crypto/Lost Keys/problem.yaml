description: Hey, I'm Cameron Wong. I had a flag ready for you, but it seems that it's locked away somewhere, and I've lost my keys... What I do have, though, is a [door]({% ctflexstatic 'door.txt' %}), maybe you can try getting into that?
hint: If your first instinct was to google my name and/or my username, you're barking up the wrong tree!
