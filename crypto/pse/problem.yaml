  We found a bunch of [weird numbers]({% ctflexstatic 'points.txt' %}) that we're
  pretty sure is an encrypted message. There was also
  [this script]({% ctflexstatic 'encrypt.py' %}) lying around near it, but we don't
  know how it works. Can you help us?

hint: |
  That 's' function looks awfully familiar...
