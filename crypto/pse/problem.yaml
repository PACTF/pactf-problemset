  We uncovered these [weird numbers]({% ctflexstatic 'points.txt' %}) from
  Dr. Miles' secret folder, but we don't know what to do with it! Can you help
  us? We also found [this script]({% ctflexstatic 'encrypt.py' %}) and
  [this data]({% ctflexstatic 'handout.txt' %}) in the same place, if it helps.

hint: |
  That 's' function seems like it does something familiar...
