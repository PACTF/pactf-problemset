  Welcome to the PA decryption service! You can decrypt any message that was
  encrypted using [this key]({% ctflexstatic 'pub.pem' %})! Don't bother trying
  to decrypt our [flag]({% ctflexstatic 'message.txt' %}), though, there's no
  way you could ever get that!
hint: |
  I wonder if we could just math out a way to get the original message?
