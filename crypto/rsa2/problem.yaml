  Welcome to the PA decryption service! You can decrypt any message that was
  encrypted using [this key]({% ctflexstatic 'pub.pem' %})! Don't bother trying
  to decrypt our [flag]({% ctflexstatic 'message.txt' %}), though, there's no
  way you could ever get that! Oh, if you're wondering, the server source can be
  found [here]({% ctflexstatic 'server.py' %})

  `nc 104.236.80.81 52747`

  I wonder if we could just math out a way to get the original message?
