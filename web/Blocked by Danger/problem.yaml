description:
    The programmers at RoboCorp take security very seriously. Their managers don't seem to, though, because intelligence recently changed their cursor icon in exchange for a manager's login credentials: "John Appleseed" and  "neVaGuessTh1sPasswrd".

    The problem is: Someone at RoboCorp messed up their serious security, and now <emph>noone</emph> can access [their website](https://example.com). Can you get to their login page and use intelligence's credentials?
hint:
    Google the error.
