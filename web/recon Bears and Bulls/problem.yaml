  FlexCorp likes to dabble in the stock market. They have managed to keep their
  investments off the books, but, vain as they are, they couldn't help but track
  how popular their investments were being, tracking this in a CSV file titled
  {% ctflexstatic 'interest.csv' %}, created in January 2004 and apparently
  accessed monthly. Can you figure out their investments (separating them with
  an underscore if necessary)?
