description: Intelligence states that the flag is located on a server with the domain 'pactf' in a remote African country on an secret sub-domain.  Can you find the correct sub-domain and TLD?
hint: |
  [Here's](www.example.com) a link to some country TLDs you might want to try.

  The sub-domain is more than 10 characters long; don't try to DDoS it. Find someone fierce instead.
