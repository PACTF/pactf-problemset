description: >
    By now you are acquainted with the powers of regex,
    but can you make a regex match only the powers of 5?
    Only a string of 5^n repeating ‘x’s should pass.
hint: >
    Take away 4/5ths of a power of 5, and you have: a power of 5.

# Consume some ‘x’s, the same number another 3 times, where 5 times was the entire string, and repeat.
