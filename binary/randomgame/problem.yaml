  The evil villains have hidden their flag behind a [machine]({% ctflexstatic "RandomGame.java" %}) that will only spit
  it back out if you can guess a random number, how devious! However, their
  programmer wasn't quite sure how to make _absolutely sure_ that things were
  random, so there's a hole in their program! Can you exploit it?

  What happens if the same person plays multiple times?
