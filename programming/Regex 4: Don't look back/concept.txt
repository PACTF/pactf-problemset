Yatharth brought up catastrophic backtracking as a problem idea way back
forever ago; I think a cool problem would be to give a list of random
characters (or random "words"!) and then a list of like, 1000 regexes,
some of which explode and some of which don't. The flag, then, would be
the word in the big text file that matches all 1000 regexes.

I implemented the problem so you have to use inverted character classes (or atomic grouping or possessive quantifiers) instead of lazy nested quantification.

It sounds like your idea could be used in a "Reverse Regex" problem, though.
